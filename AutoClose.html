	    This extension provides a quick way to mute all tabs.
	    <br/>
	    No URL and click the Mute button.

	<p>
	    This extension also allows you to either close or group
	    a collection of tabs across all windows in the browser
	    based on their URLs.
	    It is motivated by me opening a lot tabs for the same pages
	    and then having hundreds of open tabs and not being able to navigate them
	    readily and fearing closing them in case I lose something of value.
	    <p>
 		The extension works in several modes. One can apply a persistent
		set of matching URLs to regularly close or group common tabs.
	<p>
	    Alternatively, one can specify a one-time regular expression to identify tabs
	    and then close or group them into a single window.

	    <p> You can also close duplicate tabs, i.e., when we have two or more tabs
		with the exact same URL. (This can be slightly dangerous if the tabs contain different
		user information, e.g., a form.)

   		<p> And for convenience, you can also mute all tabs. (This is also available in other
		    existing extensions   but  I didn't know this before I started this differently
		    focused extension and 
	    
	    <p>
	    So the extension allows you to identify tabs to close by  matching
	    <ol>
		<li> via an exact URL that you commonly open, e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/</li>
       	        <li> via one or more regular expressions matching a URL</li>
	    </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	    Additionally, one can enter a single regular expression and match just those URLs
