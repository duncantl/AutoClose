	<p>
	    This extension allows you to either close or group
	    a collection of tabs across all windows in the browser
	    based on their URLs.
	    It is motivated by me opening a lot tabs for the same pages
	    and then having hundreds of open tabs and not being able to navigate them
	    readily and fearing closing them in case I lost something of value.
	    So the extension allows you to
	    <ol>
		<li> match an exact URL that you commonly open, e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/</li>
       	        <li> a regular expression matching a URL</li>
	    </ol>
